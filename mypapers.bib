  abstract = {A new combination diagnostic as a hydrogen recycling monitor in harsh conditions is proposed. Combining permeation membrane probe with a Langmuir probe provides a possibility to measure both atomic and ionic hydrogen fluxes to plasma facing components. A brief overview of permeation probes is given. The range of measurable H fluxes is from 1016 to more than 1020 Hm−2s−1. Time response of the permeation probe is ∼0.1−0.5 s. A method to address disadvantages of permeation probes is proposed. This includes an introduction of a preparation chamber for Ar-plasma cleaning of the membrane and absolute calibration with a visible spectroscopy. The hydrogen recombination coefficient, evaluated in such calibration, is ku=5.9×10−30m4s−1, which agrees well with previous research.}

  abstract = {We analyzed a thousand visible spectra of Fulcher-α band measured for divertor plasmas in Large Helical Device. With a coronal model and Bayesian inference, the population distribution of hydrogen molecule in the electronic ground state was estimated. The non-thermal population distribution was recovered with a two-temperature model, which has two sets of rotational and vibrational temperatures, as well as their mixture coefficient. The lower rotational temperature significantly changes according to the plasma parameters. Its nearly linear dependence on the electron density was found, which is consistent with previous works. The lower vibrational temperature also shows a small density dependence, as reported by a previous work. On the other hand, the higher rotational and vibrational temperatures as well as the mixture coefficient only show slight changes over the broad range of plasma parameters. These population parameters show a significant correlation; with higher electron density, all the temperatures and the fraction of the higher-temperature component increase simultaneously. This suggests that the electron impact plays an important role to determine the population distribution.},

It is shown that oxygen implanted in pyrolytic graphite (PG) perpendicular to basal plates is removed after sputtering the layer slightly thicker than oxygen stopping zone (≈2nm). Fast deuterium ions penetrating into CFC during GDC transfer the trapped oxygen atoms into the bulk. Thus, much thicker surface layer has to be removed (500–1000nm) for oxygen release. Irradiation of stainless steel in plasma leads to formation of a barrier layer with thickness (2–4nm) equal, or slightly higher than stopping range of oxygen ions. The layer accumulates the main fraction of implanted oxygen and prevents its penetration into the bulk. After barrier layer sputtering oxygen spreads into the bulk. Parameters and conditions of optimum GDC are discussed.},

The features of hydrogen trapping common for these devices are evaluated. It is shown that the trapping in the films of the certain device increases with the decrease of the deposition rate. Hydrogen from residual gas constitutes nearly half, or bigger part of the whole retention in the deposited films. It is trapped through inelastic interaction of the particles with the surface (“potential” mechanism of trapping). Ion irradiation and oxygen impurities activate the “potential” trapping. In conclusion some implications from the presented data are drawn.},
