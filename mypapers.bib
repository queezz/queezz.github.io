  abstract    = {Hydrogen wall pumping is studied in steady state tokamak operation (SSTO) of QUEST with all metal plasma facing materials PFMs at 100 °C. The duration of SSTO is up to 820 s in fully non-inductive plasma. Global gas balance analysis shows that wall pumping at the apparent (retention–release) rate of 1–6 × 1018 H/s is dominant and 70–80% of injected H2 can be retained in PFMs. However, immediately after plasma termination the H2 release rate enhances to ∼1019 H/s. In order to understand a true retention process the direct measurement of retention flux has been carried out by permeation probes. The comparison between the evaluated wall retention and results from global analysis is discussed.},

Incident hydrogen flux Γinc is numerically reconstructed by fitting the experimentally measured hydrogen flux Γp, permeated through the membrane. The sensitivity of the probe is improved when compared with other work which allows dynamic changes of the retention flux to be monitored, allowing detection of 10% of the Γinc modulation, or ∼1017 H m−2s−1.},

The isotope effect on the transport is studied in hydrogen (H) and deuterium (D) discharges. Flow velocities for D plasma are systematically slower, by the factor of 1.4 - 2, compared to H plasma. For all selected discharges, the carbon ions flow toward the divertor in both H and D plasmas. Different velocities are obtained depending on the charge states. For C+ and C2+ they are in the range of 10 - 30 km/s, and 5 - 20 km/s for C3+ ions. It is also found that there is no change of flow direction even in the lowest density, where the impurity transport model predicts flow toward upstream in the thermal force dominant regime. In H discharges velocities increase proportionally to the plasma density, while in D discharges this dependency is weaker. Possible mechanism to interpret these observations is discussed based on the parallel momentum balance of impurity transport.},

It is found that the flow in thick stochastic layer is faster than in thin stochastic layer configuration by a factor of 3. Different velocities of different charge states of carbon impurity are observed. The simulation with EMC3-EIRENE code shows similar trend as the experiments, but only qualitatively: faster flow in H compared to D discharges due to the mass effect, faster flow in the case of thick stochastic layer. However, synthetic spectra show discrepancy with experiments in the absolute Doppler shift, where the impurity velocity in the experiments is one order faster compared to the simulations.},

A method to address disadvantages of permeation probes is proposed. This includes an introduction of a preparation chamber for Ar-plasma cleaning of the membrane and absolute calibration with a visible spectroscopy.

With a coronal model and Bayesian inference, the population distribution of hydrogen molecule in the electronic ground state was estimated. The non-thermal population distribution was recovered with a two-temperature model, which has two sets of rotational and vibrational temperatures, as well as their mixture coefficient. The lower rotational temperature significantly changes according to the plasma parameters. Its nearly linear dependence on the electron density was found, which is consistent with previous works. The lower vibrational temperature also shows a small density dependence, as reported by a previous work. On the other hand, the higher rotational and vibrational temperatures as well as the mixture coefficient only show slight changes over the broad range of plasma parameters. These population parameters show a significant correlation; with higher electron density, all the temperatures and the fraction of the higher-temperature component increase simultaneously. This suggests that the electron impact plays an important role to determine the population distribution.},

It is shown that oxygen implanted in pyrolytic graphite (PG) perpendicular to basal plates is removed after sputtering the layer slightly thicker than oxygen stopping zone (≈2nm). Fast deuterium ions penetrating into CFC during GDC transfer the trapped oxygen atoms into the bulk. Thus, much thicker surface layer has to be removed (500–1000nm) for oxygen release. Irradiation of stainless steel in plasma leads to formation of a barrier layer with thickness (2–4nm) equal, or slightly higher than stopping range of oxygen ions. The layer accumulates the main fraction of implanted oxygen and prevents its penetration into the bulk. After barrier layer sputtering oxygen spreads into the bulk. Parameters and conditions of optimum GDC are discussed.},

Despite its universal existence, analytical descriptions of the steady-state distribution have been missing. Here, we show that the steady-state energy distribution of the wide class of collisional energy cascades can be well approximated by the generalized Mittag-Leffler distribution, which is one of stable distributions. This distribution has a power-law tail, as similar to Levy's stable distribution, the index of which is related to the energy dissipation rate. We demonstrate its universality by comparing Mont-Carlo simulations of dissipative gasses as well as the spectroscopic observation of the atom velocity distribution in a low-temperature plasma.},

  abstracttex = {Quantitative spectroscopy of molecular hydrogen has generated substantial demand, leading to the accumulation of diverse elementary process data encompassing radiative transitions, electron-impact transitions, predissociations, and quenching. However, their rates currently available are still sparse, and there are inconsistencies among those proposed by different authors. In this study, we demonstrate an experi- mental validation of such a molecular dataset by composing a collisional-radiative model (CRM) for molecular hydrogen and comparing experimentally obtained vibronic populations across multiple levels. From the population kinetics of molecular hydrogen, the importance of each elementary process in various parameter space is studied. In low-density plasmas (electron density n_e < 10^{17} m^{-3}) the excitation rates from the ground states and radiative decay rates, both of which have been reported previously, determine the excited state population. The inconsistency in the excitation rates affects the population distribution the most significantly in this parameter space. However, in higher den- sity plasmas (n_e < 10^{18} m^{-3}), the excitation rates from excited states become important, which have never been reported in the literature, and may need to be approximated in some way. In order to validate these molecular datasets and approximated rates, we carried out experimental observations for two different hydrogen plasmas; a low-density radio frequency heated plasma (n_e \approx 10^{16} m^{-3}) and the Large Helical Device (LHD) divertor plasma (n_e \gtrsim 10^{18} \mathrm{~m}^{-3}). The visible emission lines from \mathrm{EF}^1 \Sigma_{\mathrm{g}}^{+}, H \overline{\mathrm{H}}^1 \Sigma_{\mathrm{g}}^{+}, \mathrm{D}^1 \Pi_{\mathrm{u}}^{ \pm}, \mathrm{GK}^1 \Sigma_{\mathrm{g}}^{+}, \mathrm{I}^1 \Pi_{\mathrm{g}}^{ \pm}, \mathrm{J}^{\mathrm{l}} \Delta_{\mathrm{g}}^{ \pm}, \mathrm{h}^3 \Sigma_{\mathrm{g}}^{+}, \mathrm{e}^3 \Sigma_{\mathrm{u}}^{+}, \mathrm{d}^3 \Pi_{\mathrm{u}}^{ \pm} \mathrm{g}^3 \Sigma_{\mathrm{g}}^{+}, \mathrm{i}^3 \Pi_{\mathrm{g}}^{ \pm} \text {, and } \mathrm{j}^3 \Delta_{\mathrm{g}}^{ \pm} states were observed simultaneously and their population distributions were obtained from their intensities. We compared the observed population distributions with the CRM prediction, in particular the CRM with the rates compiled by Janev et al., Miles et al., and those calculated with the molecular convergent close-coupling (MCCC) method. The MCCC prediction gives the best agreement with the experiment, par- ticularly for the emission from the low-density plasma. However, the population distribution in the LHD divertor shows a worse agreement with the CRM than those from low-density plasma, indicating the necessity of the precise excitation rates from excited states. We also found that the rates for the electron attachment is inconsistent with experimental results. This requires further investigation.},

Hydrogen from residual gas constitutes nearly half, or bigger part of the whole retention in the deposited films. It is trapped through inelastic interaction of the particles with the surface (“potential” mechanism of trapping). Ion irradiation and oxygen impurities activate the “potential” trapping.

The heat flux is generated by energetic electrons excursed from the last closed flux surface. Supersonic flows in the poloidal and toroidal directions are correlated with each other. In the quasi-steady state, sawtooth-like oscillation of Ip at 20 Hz is observed. Heat flux and subsonic plasma flow in the far-SOL are modified corresponding to the Ip-oscillation. The heat flow caused by motion of energetic electrons and the bulk-particle transport to the far-SOL is enhanced during the low-Ip phase. Modification of plasma flow in the far SOL occurs earlier than the Ip crash. The M–Ip curve has a limit-cycle characteristic with sawtooth-like oscillation.

The response time at 473 K was 0.41 s and 1.3 s under an incident flux of 1020 m−2s−1 and 1019 m−2s−1, respectively.

The apparent density decay time in the far-SOL area is much longer than that in the core. Significant co-current flow is driven solely by the electron cyclotron wave in the far-SOL flow. Sheared flow is also observed in the perpendicular velocity profile during the recovered current flat-top phase, and such flow profiles are flattened by SGP. These flow profiles are attributed not only to drift-driven flow but also to transport-driven flow, the sink effect on the end-plate, and the balance of the neutral particle source.},

  abstract    = {Dependence of heating temperature on tritium retention behavior in stainless steel type 316 L (SS316L) has been examined about each process of degassing and tritium exposure. Two kinds of SS316L samples were employed: bare SS316L and plasma-exposed SS316L. The amount of tritium retained in surface layers of a sample was nondestructively measured by β-ray-induced X-ray spectrometry, and changes in the surface state with heating in vacuum were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Significant increase in tritium retention in bare SS316L samples appeared in a degassing temperature region above 600 K. Similar tendency of tritium retention was observed for the plasma-exposed sample. It was seen that the degassing process prior to tritium exposure significantly influenced to the tritium retention behavior. Furthermore, it was suggested from surface analysis by XPS that chemical states of SS316L surface at high temperatures play an important role for tritium retention behavior.},

  abstract    = {Intensity fluctuations are investigated using the fast camera imaging technique in the slab annular plasma as a function of magnetic shear and connection length in the spherical tokamak QUEST. Note that here QUEST is operated as a simple magnetized torus with a tight aspect ratio. Slab annular plasmas feature open magnetic field lines and can mimic the tokamak edge-scrape off layer (SOL)-like plasma attributes reasonably well. Three magnetic shear regimes are realized using three poloidal magnetic field (PF) coil pairs. A whole range of connection lengths (∼∞ ≥ Lc ≥ 5.5 m) is scanned by varying the PF strength for a given toroidal field for each magnetic shear regime. For the first time a systematic study of the effect of magnetic shear and field line pitch together on edge-SOL-like plasma fluctuations is being reported. Slab plasmas with intermediate magnetic shear are observed to be more susceptible to generate distinct blobs when Lc is reduced by increasing the PF strength. A distinct coherent mode appears only at the lowest magnetic shear slab featuring a deep potential well. Such mode is not apparent at other magnetic shear cases even at the same Lc. Finally, with a combination of PF coil pairs, both the features of intermediate and low magnetic shear slabs are shown to be realizable simultaneously. Significantly stronger blobs are observed with such combination of PF mirror ratios in the presence of a coherent mode. This study may provide better insight into the effect of magnetic configuration in the tokamak edge and SOL turbulence and can help in searching for better tools to control cross-field convective intermittent transport in tokamaks.},

QUEST, which is a middle-sized spherical tokamak, has hot walls that act as plasma-facing walls. They can be actively heated with sheath heaters and actively cooled with water. To control the wall temperature, heating and cooling systems have been developed. These systems adjust the power of the sheath heaters and the motor valves of the cooling system, respectively. The two systems communicate via Ethernet through UDP and control the hot-wall temperature cooperatively. The plasma control system (PCS) in QUEST has also been modified, especially with respect to gas fueling, in order to enable long-duration plasma sustainment. A feedback controller has been installed in the PCS, together with a mass flow controller, allowing Hα emission from the plasma which is used as a reference signal, to be well controlled. Plasma density calculations using a field-programmable gate array are proposed for the feedback control system.},

The scheme introduces new regularization terms in the Lagrangian function, based on the transport feature in magnetized plasma that the transport parallel to the magnetic field lines is much faster than the transport across the magnetic field, thus assuming smooth distribution in the parallel direction. The scheme is benchmarked with the test data of 3D distribution in the measurement volume, where the effectiveness of the various regularization terms is surveyed and feasibility of the scheme is confirmed. The new scheme is applied to the experimental data in LHD for carbon impurity emissions of C1+ and C3+, where the obtained distributions are discussed taking into account the plasma wall interaction and charge dependence of ionization potentials.},

Both samples of plasma-exposed and non-exposed SS316L were exposed to tritium gas under given temperature, time and pressure conditions. Surface of the former sample was covered with re-deposition layers after exposing to the plasma experiments. After tritium exposure, X-ray spectra induced by β-rays emitted from tritium atoms retained in the surface layers and/or dissolved into the bulk were measured using an ultra-low energy X-ray detector consisting of pure Ge semiconductor, and numerical analysis of the observed spectrum was conducted to estimate a tritium depth profile in the sample. As a result, it was found that the amount of tritium in surface layers of the plasma-exposed sample was about five times larger than that of the non-exposed sample, and the tritium depth profile for the plasma-exposed sample was about half depth in comparison with that for the non-exposed sample although the degassing temperature and tritium exposure conditions were the same for both samples. It was suggested, therefore, that the re-deposition layers played a role of diffusion barrier of tritium atoms formed on the sample surface.},

  abstract    = {The fuel particle balance during long duration discharges in the Q-shu University Experiment with steady state spherical tokamak (QUEST) was investigated. QUEST has all-metal plasma facing walls (PFWs) that were temperature controlled during the experiments. The presence of a transport barrier for hydrogen (H) at the interface between a plasma-induced deposition layer and metallic substrate was confirmed by nuclear reaction analysis with exposing deuterium plasma. An effective method to evaluate global hydrogen flux to PFWs is proposed, taking advantage of the nature of wall saturation. The outgoing flux of fuel particles from the PFWs just after the plasma termination was proportional to the square of wall-stored H, which indicates that enhanced recombination of solved hydrogen played an essential role in dynamic retention and was in agreement with predictions from the H-barrier model. A simple calculation based on the combination of wall modelling and rate equations of the H states denoted a significant impact of wall modelling on the time response of the plasma density. Hence, a proper wall model including the effects of the deposition layer creating the H barrier is required to be developed, even for all-metal PFW devices.},

  abstract    = {This paper presents a detailed design of the Q-shu University experimental steady state spherical tokamak's (QUEST's) high-field side (HFS) injection system for electron Bernstein wave (EBW) excitation and the results of an experimental comparison of the HFS eXtraordinary X-mode and low-field side (LFS) ordinary O-mode injection of 8.2 GHz radio frequency (RF) power. Waveguides, as an alternative to mirror polarizers for transmitting RF X-mode power from LFS to HFS for EBW conversion, were used instead of the installation of an RF mirror. Testing of LFS-to-HFS RF power transmission at 8.2 GHz, using an RG-50-type vacuum waveguide in a bench-scale device filled with SF6 gas at 0.03 Mpa, revealed that an RF power of 10.8 kW could traverse the fundamental electron cyclotron resonance layer for 60 s without breakdown. The short-length, open-ended waveguide antenna used in the HFS injection-induced wave diffraction reduced the efficiency of power delivery to the upper hybrid resonance (UHR) by approximately 7% at an electron temperature of 50 eV. The HFS injection was able to produce brighter camera images than the standard LFS injection. The location of the UHR, as estimated by measuring the density with an interferometer, agreed with its location as measured by plasma radiation low-field, side-edge positions shown by fast camera imaging. This indicates that the plasma was produced by mode-converted EBW. The HFS injection had an absorption efficiency of 96%, compared to 40% for LFS. A greater fluctuation of floating potential adjustable to the lower hybrid wave (LHW) was observed in the HFS case by installing a Langmuir probe, confirming that EBW conversion efficiency was higher in the HFS case. Moreover, after setting the poloidal field to BPF = 7.6 mT, plasma current (IP) in the HFS peaked at 1.3 kA, as opposed to 0.3 kA for LFS, despite LFS injection having a total power of 55 kW, compared to 40 kW for HFS. However, as the impurity level was comparatively high, it is believed that this IP is dominated by pressure-drive, which makes it difficult to analyze EBWCD. Finally, the line-integrated density in the HFS injection peaked at 1.6 × 1018 m−2, compared to 8 × 1017 m−2 in the LFS one.},
