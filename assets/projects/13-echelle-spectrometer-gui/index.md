The GUI is developed to work with 2D Echelle images to convert them into calibrated spectra. The GUI is written in <a href='https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>pyqt</a> and relies on <a href='https://www.pyqtgraph.org/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>pyqtgrph</a> for fast plotting.
