The GUI is developed to work with 2D Echelle images to convert them into calibrated spectra. The GUI is written in <a href='https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt'>pyqt</a> and relies on <a href='https://www.pyqtgraph.org/'>pyqtgrph</a> for fast plotting. See the project on <a href='https://github.com/queezz/echelle_spectra'>GitHub</a>.
