The GUI is developed to work with 2D Echelle images to convert them into calibrated spectra. The GUI is written in [pyqt](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt) and relies on [pyqtgrph](https://www.pyqtgraph.org/) for fast plotting. See the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/queezz/echelle_spectra).
