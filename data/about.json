The focus of my research remains the hydrogen interaction with materials in fusion applications. I am also investigating hydrogen transport through metals, exposed to hydrogen and oxygen plasmas. This time I've added to my set of tools laser techniques to investigate the surface chemistry of my samples in-situ in vacuum without exposing them to atmospheric air after experiments."

A somewhat unusual spectroscopic diagnostic for a fusion device, a high resolution and wide range spectrometer of the Echelle type, was used for my studies. I developed a tool for processing the raw images from the spectrometer written in Python. I investigated the isotope effect on the carbon impurity flow in the edge plasma of Large Helical Device (LHD). The data, collected by my system, included molecular hydrogen emission lines, which I've analyzed later."

In this work, I proposed a new glow-discharge cleaning scenario for the tokamak operation. This scenario increased the cleaning procedure efficiency and decreased time required for this unavoidable procedure. I developed a multi-spices deposition device for tungsten-carbon thin film deposition. Further, I upgraded this device to study boron-carbon films. The boron is in the form of powder and special care should be taken to prevent this powder from sputtering due to various reasons, such as charging up of boron particles. Based on my prototype device after my graduation, an improved device was designed to investigate and improve boronization efficiency for the ITER project."

Here I got my first hands-on experience with vacuum and plasma set-ups. My goal was to investigate the retention of hydrogen in the plasma-facing components of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEST_(formerly_Tore_Supra)'>Tore-Supra tokamak</a>. I found that the hydrogen retention in graphites, which were exposed to tokamak plasma, was significantly higher compared to similarly exposed graphites in the laboratory set-up. I discovered that the main hydrogen retention in Tore-Supra tiles occurs in the amorphous layer, deposited on the surface of the tiles. In the contract work with Tore-Supra tokamak team, I studied hydrogen retention in plasma-facing components. In this work, I discovered that small concentrations of oxygen in the gas mixture could lead to a significant increase in hydrogen retention."
